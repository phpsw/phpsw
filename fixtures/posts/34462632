To register - tab, top left on the attached link. One can electronically de-register if you're no longer able to attend.\r\n\r\nThere'll be a UX-related talk and groups giving talks, workshops on computing\/IT related topics that you may find of interest.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/bristol.itmega....\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nIndu\r\n",
